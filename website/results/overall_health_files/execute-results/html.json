Alternatively, **states with protective abortion policies appear to align with stronger public health systems, where access to care and preventative measures may contribute to better overall health rankings.** This pattern underscores a broader connection between policy decisions prioritizing individual health rights and the overall well-being of a population.\n\n### ANOVA Permutation Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The mean overall health rankings are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: At least one group median of overall health rankings is significantly different from the others across abortion policy levels.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = overall_health_ranking, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Overall Health Ranking\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Overall Health Ranking by State Abortion Policy\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overall_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Note**: Rankings are ordinal, where 1 represents the best state and 51 represents the worst state (including D.C.) for overall health. Interpretations should consider that rankings provide relative comparisons, not absolute measures of health. This applies to all ranked variables going forward.\n\nThe bar plot illustrates that states with \"most protective\" abortion policies have the lowest mean rankings, indicating better overall health outcomes. As abortion policies become more restrictive, the mean rankings increase, suggesting poorer overall health outcomes. States with \"most restrictive\" abortion policies have the highest mean rankings, reflecting the worst overall health outcomes in this comparison.\n\nTo complement the Kruskal-Wallis Test and evaluate whether these observed differences in means are statistically significant, an ANOVA Permutation Test was performed.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Permutation Test\nN <- 100000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova <- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F <- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F <- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data <- df\n  permuted_data$overall_health_ranking <- sample(permuted_data$overall_health_ranking)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova <- aov(overall_health_ranking ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] <- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value <- mean(perm_F >= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nObserved F-statistic: 6.588876 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nPermutation Test p-value: 4e-05 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overall_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**The permutation test yielded an extremely low p-value of 0.00004 indicating that the likelihood of observing an F-statistic as extreme as 6.588876 under the null hypothesis (that the means are equal across all groups) is very small, providing strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.** In other words, there is a significant difference in the means of overall health rankings across the levels of abortion policy suggesting that the ranking of states' overall health outcomes varies meaningfully depending on their abortion policy classifications.\n\n### Implications\n\nThe findings highlight a broader relationship between abortion policy and public health infrastructure, states with more protective abortion policies consistently demonstrate better overall health rankings, which suggests a prioritization of comprehensive healthcare systems that extend beyond reproductive care. It's possible that these states may invest more heavily in preventative care, access to healthcare services, and public health initiatives, fostering environments that support healthier populations. By contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies are associated with poorer overall health rankings, reflecting potential under investment in public health systems and preventative measures. This pattern suggests that restrictive abortion policies may be indicative of broader systemic issues in health equity and resource allocation, therefore, addressing these disparities requires a policy approach that not only ensures reproductive autonomy but also strengthens the broader healthcare infrastructure to promote better health outcomes across all states.\n\n\n## Medicaid Expansion Status by Abortion Policy\n\n### Fischer's Exact Test \n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** There is no association between Medicaid expansion status and abortion policy level.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: There is an association between Medicaid expansion status and abortion policy level.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf$medicaid_expansion <- factor(df$medicaid_expansion_status, levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot of Medicaid Expansion Status with Abortion Policies as Fill\nggplot(df, aes(x = medicaid_expansion, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Medicaid Expansion Status\", \n    y = \"Proportion\", \n    fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n    title = \"Medicaid Expansion Status by State Abortion Policy\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"Not Expanded\", \"1\" = \"Expanded\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overall_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis plot highlights how states that have not expanded Medicaid are disproportionately associated with more restrictive abortion policies. In contrast, states that have expanded Medicaid show a higher proportion of protective and less restrictive abortion policies. **This pattern suggests a potential relationship between policy choices around healthcare access (Medicaid expansion) and reproductive rights (abortion policies), where more progressive health policies align with broader healthcare access.**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fisher's Exact Test\ncontingency_table <- table(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n\nfisher_test_result <- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tFisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.03091\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe **Fisher's Exact Test** yielded a p-value of **0.03091**, indicating a statistically significant association between Medicaid expansion status and abortion policies. This suggests that the distribution of Medicaid expansion (expanded vs. not expanded) varies significantly across different abortion policy categories. States' decisions on Medicaid expansion may align with their stance on abortion policies.\n\nTo explore the direction and strength of this relationship, a logistic regression is attempted.\n\n### Exact Logistic Regression \n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** Abortion policy level has no effect on the probability of Medicaid expansion.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: At least one level of abortion policy significantly affects the probability of Medicaid expansion.\n\nBefore performing logistic regression, it is necessary to confirm that the data meets the required assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Tabulate categories to see if sample sizes are sufficient\ntable(df$medicaid_expansion_status, df$abortion_policies)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   \n    most protective very protective protective some restrictions/protections\n  0               0               0          0                             0\n  1               2               7         10                             5\n   \n    restrictive very restrictive most restrictive\n  0           3                1                7\n  1           4                3                9\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe sample sizes are too small for standard logistic regression.

The **exact logistic regression's likelihood ratio test (p = 0.0924) suggests that the overall model is not statistically significant. However, the Wald test (p = 0.0483) and previous findings from Fisher's Exact Test indicate that specific associations between abortion policy levels and Medicaid expansion status may be statistically significant. ** These differing results highlight the complexity of the relationship and suggest that while the overall model fit may not be strong, there is evidence of specific patterns worth exploring further. The trend observed in the slope coefficients indicates that states with more restrictive abortion policies tend to have lower probabilities of Medicaid expansion, whereas states with protective policies show higher probabilities of Medicaid expansion. \n\n### Implications  \n\n**This potential pattern may highlight a critical divide in policy decisions: states prioritizing broader reproductive rights are also more likely to expand healthcare access through Medicaid, whereas restrictive abortion policies align with reduced Medicaid expansion,** which underscores the broader policy implications of prioritizing access to healthcare and reproductive rights. This alignment reflects deeper policy priorities and ideological differences between states, where those prioritizing reproductive rights often demonstrate a commitment to broader public health initiatives and social safety nets. On the other hand, states with restrictive abortion policies may deprioritize investments in Medicaid and other mechanisms that improve healthcare access for vulnerable populations, further widening disparities in healthcare equity.\n\nThis divide carries significant implications for health outcomes, particularly for low-income individuals and marginalized communities who depend on Medicaid for essential care. The reduced likelihood of Medicaid expansion in restrictive states may exacerbate health inequities, leading to weakened access to preventative care, maternal healthcare, and chronic disease management. \n\n## Coverage, Access, and Affordability by Abortion Policy\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The medians of the coverage, access, and affordability rankings are equal across all levels of abortion policy.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: At least one group median of the coverage, access, and affordability rankings is significantly different across abortion policy levels.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Boxplot for coverage and abortion policies\n\n# Reorder the levels of abortion policies\ndf$abortion_policies <- factor(df$abortion_policies, \n                               levels = c(\"most protective\", \"very protective\", \n                                          \"protective\", \"some restrictions/protections\", \n                                          \"restrictive\", \"very restrictive\", \"most restrictive\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = coverage_access_and_affordability, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n    y = \"Coverage, Access, and Affordability\", \n    fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n    title = \"Coverage, Access, and Affordability by State Abortion Policy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overall_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThese box plots highlight that states with more protective abortion policies tend to have better rankings, indicating higher coverage access and affordability.

States with protective abortion policies likely integrate reproductive healthcare into comprehensive healthcare initiatives, fostering better access and affordability. **In contrast, restrictive states, which often frame their policies as being \"pro-life,\" may focus on generalized or inconsistent healthcare frameworks, leading to poorer outcomes.** The lack of affordable and accessible healthcare in these states undermines their claims to protect life, as they fail to support the broader well-being of the populations they govern. These findings underscore both the interconnectedness between reproductive healthcare policy and overall healthcare accessibility and affordability, and the disconnect in restrictive states between policy rhetoric and actionable support for healthier communities.\n\n## Prescription Contraception Coverage Requirements by Abortion Policy\n\n### Fischer's Exact Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** There is no association between prescription contraception coverage requirements and abortion policy levels.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: There is an association between prescription contraception coverage requirements and abortion policy levels.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf$requires_prescription <- factor(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, levels = c(\"0\", \"1\"))\n\n# Stacked bar plot for Prescription Contraception Coverage Requirements\nggplot(df, aes(x = requires_prescription, fill = abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(x = \"Requires Prescription Coverage\", \n       y = \"Proportion\", \n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Prescription Contraception Coverage Requirements by Abortion Policy\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"0\" = \"Does Not Require\", \"1\" = \"Requires\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + \n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 12)) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](overall_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar plot demonstrates that states that do not require prescription coverage are predominantly associated with more restrictive abortion policies, whereas states that require prescription coverage tend to align with more protective abortion policies.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontingency_table <- table(df$state_requires_coverage_of_prescription_contraception, df$abortion_policies)\nfisher_test_result <- fisher.test(contingency_table)\nprint(fisher_test_result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tFisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  contingency_table\np-value = 0.01764\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe **Fisher's Exact Test results yield a p-value of 0.01764**, indicating a statistically significant association between whether a state requires prescription coverage and its abortion policy.

relationship between abortion policy restrictiveness and the likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage, as indicated by the likelihood ratio test with a p-value of 0.0419.** Among the coefficients, states classified as having \"most restrictive\" abortion policies show the largest negative coefficient (-2.347), indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to the reference group (\"most protective\"). Similarly, states with \"very restrictive\" policies also exhibit a negative coefficient (-1.609), further supporting this trend. In contrast, the coefficients for \"protective\" and \"very protective\" policy levels are closer to zero, reflecting smaller deviations from the reference group.\n\nThe predicted probabilities demonstrate a clear gradient: states with more restrictive abortion policies consistently exhibit lower probabilities of requiring prescription contraceptive coverage compared to those with more protective policies. This pattern underscores how more restrictive policies are associated with reduced support for measures that increase contraceptive accessibility, revealing a broader policy divide between states.\n\n### Implications \n\nThis pattern highlights a significant disparity in healthcare priorities between states with restrictive and protective abortion policies.**By failing to require prescription coverage, particularly for contraceptives, these states not only limit access to essential tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, effectively undermining efforts to reduce the need for abortions in the first place, but also neglect the broader healthcare needs of individuals.** Moreover, by not mandating prescription coverage, these states create barriers for women who rely on contraceptives for managing health conditions such as dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, or hormonal imbalances. These barriers can significantly impact quality of life for women who need access to these treatments.

In contrast, states with restrictive abortion policies consistently rank worse, potentially indicating less emphasis on preventative care or healthcare quality.** This association underscores how restrictive reproductive healthcare policies may correlate with broader systemic healthcare shortcomings, which can perpetuate or exacerbate health inequities.

States with protective abortion policies consistently perform better across these measures, suggesting a commitment to fostering equitable healthcare systems that prioritize both reproductive rights and general healthcare access. These states likely integrate reproductive healthcare into broader public health initiatives, addressing root causes of poor health and promoting preventative care.In contrast, restrictive abortion policies are frequently associated with poorer health outcomes, lower healthcare quality, and reduced access to essential services. These patterns suggest that states with restrictive polcies may not only limit reproductive autonomy but also systemically under investm in public health infrastructure which can exacerbate existing inequities, leaving vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, without adequate healthcare resources.\n\nAlthough some relationships, such as OB-GYN access by abortion policy, did not achieve statistical significance, visible trends warrant further investigation. Future research could explore these patterns with more granular data or alternative methodologies to better understand the systemic implications of abortion policy restrictiveness on healthcare equity.\n",
