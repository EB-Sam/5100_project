Restricting or banning abortions increases the risk of maternal mortality, as women may be denied access to life-saving interventions in cases of complicated or life-threatening pregnancies. It is reasonable to anticipate that maternal mortality rates will climb further post-Dobbs, as states with restrictive abortion policies were already associated with higher maternal mortality rates (data is from 2020-2022). These states have historically demonstrated limited access to necessary reproductive healthcare, and further restrictions will likely exacerbate the systemic challenges that contribute to preventable maternal deaths.\n\nAdditionally, such restrictions force women, including those who are too young, facing serious health risks, or lacking financial resources or adequate health insurance, to carry pregnancies to term. These factors, which are all associated with higher maternal mortality risks, create compounded challenges for women forced into unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. By implementing restrictive abortion policies, despite data showing higher maternal mortality rates, states are effectively creating conditions that increase preventable deaths among women. This raises significant ethical and public health concerns about the systemic disregard for maternal well-being in these policy decisions.\n\n## Women who Went Without Care due to Cost by Abortion Policy\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The median percentage of women who went without care because of cost is the same across all abortion policy groups.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: At least one abortion policy group has a significantly different median percentage of women who went without care because of cost compared to the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Box plot visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = women_18_44_who_went_without_care_because_of_cost, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Without Care per 100,000\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women who went Without Care due to Cost by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe box plot reveals that states with \"most protective\" abortion policies tend to have the lowest median percentage of women who went without care due to cost, with a smaller interquartile range indicating more consistent outcomes.

Together, these factors could worsen disparities, leaving more women unable to access the care they need during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum, particularly in underserved communities which reinforces the interconnectedness of abortion policy, maternal health, and systemic inequities in healthcare access.\n\n## Uninsured Women During Pregnancy by Abortion Policy\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The median percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is the same across all abortion policy groups.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: The median percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is different in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Box plot visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Women Uninsured (2021)\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percentage of Women Uninsured During Pregnancy in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis box plot indicates that states with \"most protective\" abortion policies have the lowest median percentage of women uninsured during pregnancy in 2021, with minimal variability.

Interestingly, for the \"most restrictive\" policy level, the median and range drop significantly compared to the \"very restrictive\" group. This deviation could reflect unique policy or demographic factors in those states. However, the broader trend suggests that more restrictive abortion policies may align with higher uninsured rates during pregnancy.\n\nTo further validate the significance of these findings, we will now perform an ANOVA permutation test.\n\n### ANOVA Permutation Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is the same across all abortion policy groups.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: The mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy is different in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021, fill = abortion_policies)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\", position = \"dodge\") + theme_minimal() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.4)) + labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", y = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy\", fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\", title = \"Mean Women Uninsured During Pregnancy in 2021 by State Abortion Policy\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe bar chart shows that states with more protective abortion policies have the lowest mean percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy, as abortion policies become more restrictive, the mean percentage of uninsured women generally increases, peaking at the \"very restrictive\" level before dropping at the \"most restrictive\" level. \n\nTo strengthen the evidence for statistical significance,an ANOVA Permutation Test is performed. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Permutation Test\nN <- 10000 \n\n# Observed ANOVA F-statistic\nobserved_anova <- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = df)\nobserved_F <- summary(observed_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n\n# Permutation loop\nset.seed(1234) \nperm_F <- numeric(N)\n\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  # Permute the response variable\n  permuted_data <- df\n  permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 <- sample(permuted_data$percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021)\n  \n  # Perform ANOVA on permuted data\n  perm_anova <- aov(percent_uninsured_women_during_pregnancy_2021 ~ abortion_policies, data = permuted_data)\n  perm_F[i] <- summary(perm_anova)[[1]][[\"F value\"]][1]\n}\n\n# Calculate p-value\np_value <- mean(perm_F >= observed_F)\n\ncat(\"Observed F-statistic:\", observed_F, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nObserved F-statistic: 4.561629 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"Permutation Test p-value:\", p_value, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nPermutation Test p-value: 0.0252 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot the permutation F-statistics\nhist(perm_F, \n     breaks = 30, \n     main = \"Permutation Distribution of F-statistic\", \n     xlab = \"F-statistic\", \n     col = \"palegreen4\",  \n     border = \"white\")    \n\n# F-statistic line \nabline(v = observed_F, \n       col = \"red\",       \n       lwd = 2, \n       lty = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation test yields a p-value of 0.0252, providing statistically significant evidence to support differences in the percentage of uninsured women during pregnancy across at least one abortion policy level.

Increasingly restrictive policies may contribute to increased maternal mortality and morbidity by limiting access to affordable prenatal care, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment. Additionally, healthcare providers may be less inclined to practice in these states, further reducing access to quality care. Over time, these conditions could place growing financial strain on households and healthcare systems, deepening existing inequities.\n\n## Teen Birth Rate by Abortion Policy\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The median teen birth rate (per 1,000 population, ages 15–19) is the same across all abortion policy groups.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: The median teen birth rate (per 1,000 population, ages 15–19) differs in at least one of the abortion policy groups.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Boxplot visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = `teen_birth_rate_per_1,000_population_ages_15_19_2022`, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"Teen Birth Rate per 100,000\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Teen Birth Rate by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe box plot illustrates a clear trend where states with more protective abortion policies tend to have lower median teen birth rates, while states with more restrictive policies show higher median teen birth rates.

While we have not examined related factors like comprehensive sex education, these results raise questions about whether states with more restrictive abortion policies also fail to invest enough in preventive measures and support systems, prompting a need for more research and evidence-based policy interventions.\n\n## Change in Clinician-Provided Abortions Since 2020 by Sate\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usmap)\nabortion_map_data <- df %>%\n  select(State, `percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(`percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    state = State,\n    change = `percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`\n  ) \n\nplot_usmap(data = abortion_map_data, values = \"change\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    name = \"% Change\",\n    low = \"#ff6b6b\",   \n    mid = \"#ffffff\",    \n    high = \"#4dbd00\",  \n    midpoint = 0,\n    na.value = \"gray80\"  \n  ) +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Change in Clinician-Provided Abortions Since 2020 by State\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n**Null Hypothesis (H*o*):** The median percentage increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020 is the same across all abortion policy levels.\n\n**Alternative Hypothesis (H*a*)**: The median percentage increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020 differs in at least one abortion policy level group.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Boxplot visualization\nggplot(df, aes(x = abortion_policies, y = `percent_increase_in_clinician_provided_abortions_since_2020`, fill=abortion_policies)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#1c7416\", \"#68bb59\", \"#acdf87\", \"#fab733\", \"#ff6242\", \"#ff0000\", \"#c61a09\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Abortion Policies\", \n       y = \"% Increase in Clinician Provided Abortions since 2020\",\n       fill = \"State Abortion Policy Level\",\n       title = \"Percent Increase in Clinician Provided Abortions since 2020 by State Abortion Policy\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 13, hjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](maternal_health_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis box plot show that states labeled as “restrictive” exhibit the largest median percentage increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020, along with a wide range of values whereas states with policies at the extremes—either the \"most protective\" or the \"most restrictive\" tend to cluster at lower percentage increases.

It may suggest that this variable isn’t sensitive to policy variations, other factors overshadow policy influence, or it was included without a clear rationale. Without evidence of a meaningful relationship, focusing research efforts elsewhere might be more productive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEvidently, maternal health outcomes differ by abortion policy level, where protective policies often align with lower maternal mortality rates, fewer uninsured pregnant women, and lower teen birth rates. This suggests that states with supportive abortion policies coincide with better access to essential healthcare services and resources for women. By contrast, restrictive policies correlate with higher maternal mortality and teen birth rates, plus more uninsured pregnant women. This association implies that states limiting abortion access may also limit other forms of care, leaving women without adequate prenatal and postnatal support. In practice, this can force both adolescents and adults into parenthood under challenging conditions, with potential long-term social and economic consequences.\n\nThese patterns underscore that abortion policies are not isolated decisions. They reflect and influence broader healthcare availability, education, and economic stability for women. In the post-Dobbs environment, with abortion restrictions likely to increase, policymakers and stakeholders should consider how these measures fit into a wider effort to improve maternal health. Evidence-based policies that promote accessible care, comprehensive sex education, and supportive economic measures can help mitigate the negative maternal health outcomes associated with restrictive abortion laws\n",
